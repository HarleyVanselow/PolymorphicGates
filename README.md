The body of code that powers this application resides in ConsoleApplication2/Program.cs. The gate class
is present in ConsoleApplication2/Class1.cs

PolymorphicGates contains a Gate class, from which several subclasses are defined. Each subclass imitates
a variety of logic gate- AND, OR, XOR or NAND. Using these subclasses, truth tables for individual gates can be outputted,
as well as truth tables for several cascaded logic gates.
